These three projects cover certain topics in digital communication field 
where the first project cover the concept of Statistical and time autocorrelation funtions and also cover the concept of realizations and ensemble
The second project cover the Matched filter & the pulse-shaping concept exist at the recieving terminal Rx
The third project cover the different digital modulation techniques as BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16-QAM, FSK . And how to design the Mapper and the DeMapper for each modulation technique in order to minimize the bit error rate
